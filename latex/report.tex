\title{A Comparative Evaluation on Network \\Representation Learning Techniques}

% Authors must not appear in the submitted version. They should be hidden
% as long as the \iclrfinalcopy macro remains commented out below.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this project, we investigate the effectiveness of different techniques to extract features from graph data.
We consider matrix methods, as well as algorithms based on random walks and graph convolutional neural networks. We evaluate the performance of these methods for classification based on ground-truth communities. We found that the performance of each method varies depending on the data considered and no \emph{silver bullet} solution exists. The code, presentation slides, and relevant resources can be found at \url{https://github.com/kameranis/EC503-NRL}.
