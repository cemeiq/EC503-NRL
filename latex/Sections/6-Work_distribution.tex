\section{Work Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Konstaninos Ameranis: Code for downloading and cleaning datasets. Code for running algorithms
on datasets and classification on produced embeddings. Section about datasets, tasks and
results.
\item Panagiota Kiourti: code for installing and running DeepWalk, node2vec, HARP. Sections explaining random walks and the following methods: DeepWalk, word2vec, 
node2vec.
\item Konstantinos Sotiropoulos: Worked on Graph Neural Networks: Explored and chose the papers from the literature, designed experiments, implemented and modified code, run the experiments, and wrote the relevant section. 
\item Erasmo Tani: Worked on the theory part of the MDS and Spectral Embedding, wrote the corresponding section, the introduction and the abstract.
\item Isidora Tourni: Performed the theoretical analysis of LINE, HARP, wrote the corresponding sections, and also contributed to the introduction sections and graph neural networks' results section. Also contributed to the HARP code parameterization.
