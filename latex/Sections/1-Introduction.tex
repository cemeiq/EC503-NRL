\section{Introduction}
Graphs data is pervasive in modern data analysis. In Computer Science, graphs have been an object of study for decades representing a fundamental tool in the area of data structures and algorithms, and a model for systems ranging from computer networks and social networks to the World Wide Web. The impact of graphs has however vastly exceeded the boundaries of computer science, as these models have been used in fields as diverse as Biology, where they are used, for instance, to represent protein interaction networks, and Operation Research, in which they are used to model infrastructure networks, such as systems of roads or pipes.

A (undirected) graph is a pair $(V,E)$, where $V$ is a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and $E$ is a collection of edges (/links). Each element of $E$ is a two-element subset $\{v,u\}$ of $V$, encoding the property that the vertex $u \in V$ is connected to the vertex $v \in V$.
